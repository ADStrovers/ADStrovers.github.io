title:  "Day Two - Feeling Good!"

So today waskind of a win all around.  We ended up going back to a project we had started yesterday called Checksplitter which took in a check and split it between the number of guests at the table, including tip.  Today we were tasked with creating a new class for Din(n)er Clubs (There was a little bit of confusion around Diner or Dinner club...  Heh.) and then having it track both the club member's running balance and also every event that the club held.  On top of that we had to allot for events that were treated by a single member.

This lead me to finding the * (splat) mark to use for parameters so I could take multiple names of the guests without having to define how many names it HAS to take.  Though this lead me to the question of...  can you splat hashes?  I am planning on attempting that tomorrow and hopefully everything will be good.
